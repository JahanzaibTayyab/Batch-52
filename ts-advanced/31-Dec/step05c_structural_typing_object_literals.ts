// These two interfaces are completely
// transferrable in a structural type system:

interface Ball {
  diameter: number;
}

interface Sphere {
  diameter: number;
}

let ball: Ball = { diameter: 10 };
let sphere: Sphere = { diameter: 20 };
console.log(ball); //10
console.log(sphere); //20

sphere = ball;
ball = sphere;

console.log("after", sphere); //10
console.log("after", ball); //10

// If we add in a type which structurally contains all of
// the members of Ball and Sphere, then it also can be
// set to be a ball or sphere.

interface Tube {
  diameter: number;
  length: number;
}

let tube: Tube = { diameter: 12, length: 3 };

//tube = ball; //Error
ball = tube;

// Because a ball does not have a length, then it cannot be
// assigned to the tube variable. However, all of the members
// of Ball are inside tube, and so it can be assigned.

// TypeScript is comparing each member in the type against
// each other to verify their equality.

//===================================================

// Now lets do it Case By Case

//Case when "FRESH"" object literal are assigned to a variable
//Rule: When a fresh object literal is assigned to a variable or passed for a parameter of a non-empty target type,
//it is an error for the object literal to specify properties that don't exist in the target type.
//The rationale for the below two errors is that since the fresh types of the object literals are
//never captured in variables, static knowledge of the excess or misspelled properties should not be silently lost.

let myType = { name: "Zia", id: 1 };

//Case 1
myType = { id: 2, name: "Tom" }; //Case 1: can only assign a type which has the the same properties
//Object literals can only have properties that exist in contextual type

//Case 2a
//myType = { id: 2, name_person: "Tom" }; //Case 2a: Error, renamed or missing property

//Case 2b
//A type can include an index signature to explicitly indicate that excess properties are permitted in with fresh objects:

let abc: { id: number; [a: string]: any }; //Note now 'x' can have any name, just that the property should be of type string

abc = { id: 1, fullName: "Zia" }; // Ok, `fullname` matched by index signature
abc = { id: 1, name7: "Zia2", fullName: "Zia" };
const newArray123 = Object.keys(abc);
console.log(
  "ðŸš€ ~ file: step05c_structural_typing_object_literals.ts:71 ~ newArray:",
  newArray123
);

//Case 3
//myType = { id: 2, name: "Tom", age: 22 }; //Case 3: Error, excess property

//=================================================

//Case when STALE object literal are assigned to a variable

let myType2 = { id: 2, name: "Tom" };

//Case 1
myType = myType2; //Case 1: can only assign a type which has the the same properties, rule same for fresh and stale object

let myType3 = { id: 2, name_person: "Tom" };
//Case 2a
//myType = myType3; //Case 2: Error, renamed or missing property, rule same for stale and fresh object

//Case 2b
//A type can include an index signature to explicitly indicate that excess properties are permitted in with fresh objects:

var x: { id: number; [x: string]: any }; //Note now 'x' can have any name, just that the property should be of type string
var y = { id: 1, fullname: "Zia" };
x = y; // Ok, `fullname` matched by index signature

var myType4 = { id: 2, name: "Tom", age: 22 };

//Case 3
myType = myType4; //Case 3: Ok, excess property allowed in case of stale object which is different from fresh object

/*
var x: { foo: number };
x = { foo: 1, baz: 2 };  // Error, excess property `baz`

var y: { foo: number, bar?: number };
y = { foo: 1, baz: 2 };  // Error, excess or misspelled property `baz`



var a: { foo: number };
var a1 = { foo: 1, baz: 2 };
a = a1;//No Error

var z: { foo: number, bar?: number };
var z1 = { foo: 1, baz: 2 };
z = z1;//No Error
