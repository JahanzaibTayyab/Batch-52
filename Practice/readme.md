# Programming Practice README

This repository contains a set of programming challenges covering various topics to help you practice and enhance your coding skills. Below is an overview of the tasks included in this practice set, along with helpful hints or descriptions to guide you through the solutions:

## Basics

### 1. Variable Assignment
Create a variable named `name` and assign it a string value.

### 2. Addition Function
Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

### 3. Even or Odd Check
Implement a conditional statement to check if a given number is even or odd. Consider using the modulus operator `%` for this task.

## Functions

### 4. String Concatenation
Build a function that concatenates two strings and returns the result.

### 5. Rectangle Area Calculation
Create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle using width and height parameters. Remember the formula: `area = width * height`.

### 6. Palindrome Check
Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome. Consider reversing the string and comparing it with the original.

## Objects

### 7. Book Object
Define an object representing a book with properties like title and author.

### 8. Display Book Details Method
Add a method to the book object to display its details. You can use string formatting to present the information neatly.

### 9. Person Object
Create an object representing a person with properties for name, age, and address.

## Arrays

### 10. Fruits Array and Loop
Declare an array of fruits and print each one using a loop. You can use a `for` loop to iterate through the array.

### 11. Average of Numbers in Array
Write a function to find the average value of numbers in an array. Sum the elements and divide by the length of the array.

### 12. Concatenate Arrays
Concatenate two arrays without modifying the original arrays. You can use the `+` operator for concatenation.

## Array Methods

### 13. Filter Even Numbers
Use the `filter` method to get an array of even numbers from a given array. Utilize a lambda function as the filtering condition.

### 14. Transform Words to Lengths
Transform an array of words into a new array with the lengths of each word. The `map` function might be useful here.

### 15. Positive Elements Check
Write a function that checks if all elements in an array are positive using the `every` method.

## Loops

### 16. For Loop
Create a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5. Use the `range` function to generate the numbers.

### 17. While Loop Countdown
Write a while loop that counts down from 10 to 1. Initialize a counter and decrement it in each iteration.

### 18. Find Index in Array
Use a loop to find the index of a specific element in an array. Iterate through the array and check for equality.

## Callback Functions

### 19. setTimeout Callback
Implement a callback function within a `setTimeout` to log a message after a delay. Be aware of the asynchronous nature of `setTimeout`.

### 20. Callback Invocation
Create a function that takes a callback and invokes it with a provided value. This demonstrates the concept of higher-order functions.

## Promises

### 21. Delayed Promise
Build a promise that resolves with a message after a delay. Use the `async` and `await` keywords for asynchronous operations.

### 22. Chained Promises
Chain two promises to perform sequential asynchronous operations. Ensure that the second operation depends on the result of the first one.

### 23. Concurrent Promises
Use `Promise.all` to handle multiple promises concurrently. This can improve the efficiency of asynchronous operations.

## Advanced Topics

### 24. Default Parameter
Implement a function with a default parameter. This provides a default value if the parameter is not explicitly provided.

### 25. Sort Objects by Property
Create an array of objects and sort them based on a specific property. Utilize the `sorted` function and a lambda function as the key.

### 26. Rest Parameters
Write a function that uses rest parameters to calculate the sum of an arbitrary number of arguments. This allows flexibility in the number of arguments.

## Logic Building

### 27. Nested Loops
Solve a problem that requires nested loops. Nested loops are useful for handling two-dimensional data structures.

### 28. Second-Largest Number
Write a function to find the second-largest number in an array. Sort the array in descending order and retrieve the second element.

### 29. Leap Year Check
Implement a program that checks if a given year is a leap year. Leap years have specific conditions, such as being divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless also divisible by 400.

### 30. Basic Quiz Simulation
Create a simple program that simulates a basic quiz using arrays and loops. Utilize arrays to store questions and answers, and loops for user interaction.
